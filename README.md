## 🖼️ Screenshot to Code

Screenshot to Code is an AI-powered web tool that converts UI screenshots into clean, production-ready frontend code.
Upload any design screenshot and instantly get structured HTML, Tailwind CSS, or React components — no manual recreation needed.
Built to save developers time, eliminate repetitive UI work, and accelerate prototyping.

🎯 What is Screenshot to Code?

Screenshot to Code bridges the gap between design and development.
Instead of manually rebuilding UIs from screenshots or design mockups, developers can simply:
📸 Upload a screenshot
🤖 Let AI analyze the layout with precision
🧩 Get pixel-perfect frontend code instantly
The generated code can be used as a starting point for websites, dashboards, and web apps — with exact colors, spacing, and typography.

🌟 Why This Exists

Every developer has faced this pain:

Designers share screenshots instead of code
Rebuilding UI manually wastes hours
Small layout mistakes creep in
Repetitive HTML/CSS slows down projects

Screenshot to Code fixes this.
✔ Faster UI development
✔ Less manual effort
✔ Rapid prototyping
✔ Cleaner starting code
