# 🖼️ Screenshot to Code  

**Screenshot to Code** is an AI-powered web tool that converts UI screenshots into clean, production-ready frontend code.  
Upload any design screenshot and instantly get structured **HTML, Tailwind CSS, or React components** — no manual recreation needed.

Built to save developers time, eliminate repetitive UI work, and accelerate prototyping.

> ⚙️ Built with **React + Google Gemini AI**

## 🎯 What is Screenshot to Code?

Screenshot to Code bridges the gap between **design and development**.

Instead of manually rebuilding UIs from screenshots or design mockups, developers can simply:

📸 Upload a screenshot  
🤖 Let AI analyze the layout with precision  
🧩 Get pixel-perfect frontend code instantly  

The generated code can be used as a starting point for websites, dashboards, and web apps — with exact colors, spacing, and typography.

## 🌟 Why This Exists

Every developer has faced this pain:

- Designers share screenshots instead of code  
- Rebuilding UI manually wastes hours  
- Small layout mistakes creep in  
- Repetitive HTML/CSS slows down projects  

**Screenshot to Code fixes this.**

✔ Faster UI development  
✔ Less manual effort  
✔ Rapid prototyping  
✔ Cleaner starting code
